# bookshelf

In this project I create a simple UI to display book information that is inputted into a form

Learning goals: 
-Work with ES6 class constructor
-Get more experience manipulating objects and arrays

Post-mortem: 

The first time I attempted my project I got frustrated because I felt that I didn't know enough in order to fulfill the requirements. I decided to step away from it for a week and keep learning, and when I came back to the project with my new knowledge it felt much easier. I had to learn how to collect the data from the form, and once I was able to do that, it all came together. 

I feel much more confident working with constructors, objects, and arrays. I also gained some confidence in my DOM manipulation, as I had to do a fair bit of problem solving to get it to work the way I wanted. 

I would like to revisit this project later once I have learned how to create a page with responsive design. I know the focus of the project was on manipulating data, so I didn't spend much time on the styling, but I would love to be able to create pages that look better and act responsively.
